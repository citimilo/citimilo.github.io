You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
I think this is good
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

早上看到日银要8点开会的消息，立刻入场，仓位太重0.05lot，然后又觉得可能没什么新东西，止损出场。然后又觉得既然没有什么新东西，就应该做空,0.02lot。又承受了近50点的浮亏。

warning!又是临时单，思考时间不超过10秒，而且出入场的位置不好。

今天还做空了0.01lot的EURNZD和EURAUD，打算拿上一周。没有设置止损。
